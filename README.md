# B.O.N.K. - Bandwidth Oversight and Network kommander

### What's BONK?
It is a network heatmap project made for the hostel of IIIT Nagpur, which aims to fasten the resolution of any LAN related internet issues.

### How does it work?
The desktop app is responsible for collecting data from each individual and mapping it to their respective rooms. This is then sent to the admin page where you can see the heatmap for the network stability of the entire hostel.
