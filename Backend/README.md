## B.O.N.K. - The Backend v1.0.0
~~_(sounds like a movie lol)_~~

### What is this?
This is the backend for the B.O.N.K. project. It is a REST API (uses node and express) to connect to a mongodb database.

Used for storing network data of all the rooms in IIIT Nagpur. [ This sounds evil... trust me it isn't :) ]

### Things to do
- [x] Do the `README.md` file
- [x] Create the routes
- [x] Add error handling messages
- [ ] Setup config files and env variables
- [x] Setup database (initialize)
- [ ] Write tests (I don't think I will)
